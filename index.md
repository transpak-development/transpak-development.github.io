# Introduction

From the perspective of even a seasoned developer there are ***a lot*** of new technologies and concepts you need to be familiar with to effectively contribute to a modern software engineering effort. Furthermore, it's hard to know exactly where to start on this journey and how to stay on the optimal path through the multitude of web-pages, READMEs, FAQs, blog posts, and third-party documentation you encounter along the way.

In this brief guide we attempt to provide just such a starting point for developers new to TransPak and its long list of technologies. Our goal is to help you navigate step-by-step past each technological challenge, summarize the essential knowledge you need to keep going, and point out important internal and external resources you will want to circle back to later once you are well on your way to delivering real business for both TransPak and its employees alike.

## Setting expectations

The Technology Services group at TransPak maintains an official [working agreement](https://tbd.tbd) designed to facilitate a positive and productive working relationship between its staff and other stakeholders throughout the company. **This is an important document** and you should read it in its entirety and bookmark it to refer to later. In fact, many of the topics we will consider in this guide are sourced directly from the working agreement and expanded on to add clarity, detail, and substance.

## Where to find help

If you have questions or run into issues while following along with this guide feel free to ask us for help on Teams. Google and ChatGPT are surprisingly good resources, as always, but sometimes miss the mark ... when this happens we are here to help!

## A look ahead

We use ***DotNet Core\*** to write code and tests and use ***Git\*** to handle version control. Combined with judicious use of the ***command line\*** this suite of technologies will allow us to rapidly and reliably deliver value while staying "in the flow."

In the next few sections we briefly introduce you to each of these technologies after which we provide a comprehensive tutorial to help you learn *just enough* of each to kick start your development efforts.
